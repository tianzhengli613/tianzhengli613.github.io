		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>Ever since I was young I had an interest in art. It wasn't until my senior year in high school when I began to take it seriously with the mindset of improving enough to be professional. As an entirely self-taugh artist, I've never had the opportunity of taking any courses but I spent a lot of effort trying to learn everything myself, both as a challenge and as my preferred way to take mmy art journey. It was that same senior year that I bought my first tablet, a Wacom Intuos Draw. Since my fundamentals were still lacking, a fact that I didn't realize till much later, my endeavors in digital art consisted mostly of painting. After a year or so of this, I realized that even though my painting looked decent to my untrained eyes my drawing skills were very subpar. After spending most of my time afterwards dedicated to just drawing, I've come to enjoy illustration deeply.</p>
